These files on their own aren't too useful, you need to combine them with an appropriate copy of the Simutrans source code. This can be obtained from the Simutrans source code repository, see http://simutrans.com/development.htm#Source_code for details.

(Note: Some revisions also need patches against the Simutrans source code, due to files managed under Subversion being changed.)

(Note 2: The BSD licence associated with this project applies only to the files managed here, as part of the Simutrans OSX port. Simutrans itself is released under an Artistic licence, the full text of which is distributed along with the Simutrans project. I make no claims to the Simutrans name and use it with permission of the Simutrans community.)
